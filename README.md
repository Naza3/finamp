## FAQ


| | |
|:----:|:----:|
| Free | Supported Formats |
| Yes. Contributions and donations of any kind are of course welcome! | Mostly All. Generally speaking if Jellyfin and your Device support an format, finamp will too! In case an format doesn't work you can always enable transcoding. |
| Android Auto / Apple Carplay | Legality |
| No, but yes. Native support is in development but you can still connect your phone to your car and start listening. | Finamp is Legal. Because Finamp requires a Jellyfin server for streaming Music the Admin is responsible for buying music from Artists. |
